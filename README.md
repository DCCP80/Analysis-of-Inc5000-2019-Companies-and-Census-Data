# Analysis-of-Inc5000-2019-Companies-and-Census-Data
this is a comparison of the Inc5000 companies in 2019 and census data. 

Abstract:
Inc.com is a magazine devoted to private business and entrepreneurs. They publish a list of the 5000 fastest growing private business every year. The growth is calculated using the revenue from the previous year. These companies also must meet a strict criterion to be included in the list so this ensures a unique data set. The following analysis will first analyze this data set to identify key patterns in terms of geography and then compare the results with census data including earnings, health, education, population, and urban density. The comparison will determine if there are any strong or weak correlations and if it is possible to identify a combination of attributes that will either encourage or discourage the growth of these companies. The results show there are clear and strong relationships between the population of the state, the education, the poverty, and the growth of these companies. There are also negative relationships between the companies with the lowest growth and states with lowest population. However, this analysis also highlighted discrepancies in some of the population data and with the distribution of much of the data. The primary goal was to investigate the relationships between the growth of these specific companies using advanced data analysis. There is much more to be learned from this analysis and workflow.
